      <center><p class="ap">Explore with Animals is an educational website for children between the ages of three and five to help educate them on different types of  animals and the noises that they make.There are twelve total animals offered on the site, which include;  lion, monkey, cat, dog, pig, sheep, elephant, chicken, cow, frog, bear, and owl. When the child hovers over the animal&rsquo;s depiction, the animals will shake from side to side indicating for the child to click on the image. When they do click on the animal, a recording of that animal&rsquo;s specific vocalization will activate and play. This website not only educates with the basic animal noises and animation, but helps guide the child in learning how to navigate the internet in a technologically advancing society, via simply teaching them how to click and hover. These are basic skills that will guide the child&rsquo;s further technological learnings and build a foundation for more advanced learning.</p></center>
